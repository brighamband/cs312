In this class at BYU, we went over several general approaches to algorithm design, including Divide and Conquer, Graph-based, Greedy, Dynamic Programming, Linear Programming, and Intelligent Search. We tackled projects which solved the famous traveling salesman problem, basic cryptography, primality testing, convex hulls, gene sequencing, and networking routing.
